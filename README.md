# PythonTopicalPractice
  
#Hello friends and gentlepeople, lend me your ears. This repository is a collection of labs absorbed from a program I recently graduated in which we learned the basics of Python for Cybersecurity. I was to make clear we were encouraged by our school to incorporate the labs into our portfolios, and I want to give due credit to the team at ThriveDX for the skeletal lab templates which I have now taken and made my own, and shared, as per their wise advice. I'm excited to join such a collaborative community as cybersecurity and programming, computer arts and sciences. If you do something cool with these as a template, lmk I'd LOVE to see. I've done my best to place them under an educational license. Pax. +
