# PythonTopicalPractice
  
#Hello friends and gentlepeople, lend me your ears. This repository is a collection of labs absorbed from a program I recently graduated in which we learned the basics of Python for Cybersecurity. I was to make clear we were encouraged by our school to incorporate the labs into our portfolios, and I want to give due credit to the team at ThriveDX for the initial labs which I have now taken and made my own and posted, as per their good advice. I do not give credit to myself for generating them in a vacuum, as I didn't. I'm excited to join such a collaborative community. If you do something cool with these as template, lmk I'd love to see. I've done my best to place them under an educational license. Pax. +
